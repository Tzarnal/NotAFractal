#By design not all nodes are included in the project, don't worry, as long as your node is a .yaml file in the FractalNodes directory it will be used.
Title:          Not A Fractal
Name:           A limited subset of everything   
SidebarText:    
    Not a Fractal is named this way because a 2012 study found that the universe is probably not a fractal. And thats a marginally more clever name then Universe. <br> <br>
    If you prefer, have a link to a new <a href="/Home/Random">Random</a> Universe.

#Fractal Nodes are the thing that Not A Fractal trees are built out of
#Template.yaml is a self documenting example of how these files are made
#Normally RootNode.yaml is the node used when you open the homepage
#Everything Branches from RootNode.yaml

#In any place you can use strings you can use datagenrator symbols ( $aword$ ) which will get replaced by data
#from a datagenerator yaml file, the same $symbol$ will be replaced with the same thing 
#in every entry as long as they are usedin the same order.

#Data Generator files use a somewhat complex notaion to make generated text
#You can use Generator Files in Fractal Node files to include stuff like unique names
#If you write $GeneratorName$ that will corrospond to a file name without the .yaml and it will be replaced with DataGenerator created text

#You can use any number of the below blocks, which will strung together in sequence
#These blocks will pick 1 of the entries in such a block, the choise is weighted by the number provided

#If you want to make a node option including an empty string with a heavy weight will acomplish this
#You can use DataGenerator Symbols in DataGenerators, just try to avoid infinite loops
#Using the same $symbol$ twice will have that symbol replace with the same data, keep this in mind.
